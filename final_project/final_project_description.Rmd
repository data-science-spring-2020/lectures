# General Description

- The final project consists of a real data analysis, culminating in
  presenting the results of your analysis in the form of a Shiny App.
  
- You will choose a dataset to analyse. Based on the results of the analysis,
  you will choose what to present in your Shiny App. 

- The final project is required for all those enrolled in STAT 613. It is
  optional for those enrolled in STAT 413.

# (5 pts) Team and Data Selection

- For the final project you will work in groups of size 2 (minimum) or 3 (maximum). 

- Below are some possible sources for data. Each dataset may only be used by 
  one group.

- If you have had a class with me before using these datasets, then you must
  choose a different dataset to analyze.

- Please email me your top three dataset choices, along with your group members.

- I will accept other sources as long as they are comparably large and 
  complicated. For example, there are many open data portals from state 
  agencies (<https://opendata.dc.gov/>).

- I will not accept small curated datasets, or those that come from a paper
  where the data has already been analyzed.
  
- You should not select a dataset that you have used before, or are currently 
  using in another class.

# (5 pts) Progress Report

- Midway through the semester, I will look at your GitHub repo to make sure
  that you are making progress.
  
- You will be graded on the following:
    - Datasets are downloaded and placed in the data folder.
    - Initial explorations have occurred in the analysis folder. These
      should include plots and summary statistics.

- Additionally, you should place in the analysis folder a document that
  describes:
    - What additional analyses will you perform?
    - What are some tentative ideas for your Shiny app?
    
- You should call this document "TODO.md".

  
# (20 pts) Shiny App

You will be graded on the complexity of your app, the complexity of the analysis,
and **how well the reactive elements improve your data presentation**.

- Examples for what reactive elements improve:
    - Highly improves: 
        - Change a plot based on the time the units were collected, 
          demonstrating an evolving relationship between variables.
        - Plot data according to the different levels of a categorical variable
          to better explore multidimensional relationships.
    - Moderately improves: 
        - Selecting variables to plot.
        - Changing bin width of a histogram to look at different
          scales of the distribution.
        - Demonstrating how variable transformations result in
          linear relationships.
    - Does not improve: 
        - Delayed evaluation where the evaluation would be
          instantaneous anyway.

Your Shiny app should contain all of the following elements:

- A sophisticated and visually pleasing layout.
- Reactive elements that improve the presentation of results.
- At least one statistical inference procedure ($t$-tests, simple linear 
  regressions, ANOVA, etc).
- Interactive graphics.
- Modified HTML elements.
- You should not be doing intensive data cleaning inside your shiny app. 
  Your shiny app should use cleaned datasets that were cleaned by scripts in
  your analysis folder.

# (10 pts) Presentation

- During the final exam period, each group will showcase their Shiny app
  with a 15 minute presentation.

- This presentation should **not** contain any slides, just the Shiny app.

- You should present the conclusions of your analysis using your Shiny app
  by interactively showing the class the results that you've found.
  
- Each group member should talk for a proportionate amount of time. So if there
  are two group members, each one should speak for about 7 or 8 minutes. 
  If there are three group members, each one should speak for about 5 minutes.

# (10 pts) GitHub Repo

- Each group will share a single GitHub repo. What work was done by 
  whom will be viewable in the commit history in the repo.
  
- Your repo will consist of the following folders:
  - app: The location of the Shiny app.
  - analysis: Analysis scripts and Rmd files used to clean and explore data.
  - data: Location of raw, unmodified datasets.
  - output: Location of modified datasets.
  
- You will be graded on:
  - Frequency of commits.
      - Do you just commit whole files (bad), or do you commit each time
        you make significant progress (good)?
  - Organization of files.
      - Do you have all of your analyses in one big mega file (bad) or do 
        you split up your analyses into small analysis files in the 
        analysis folder that perform specific tasks (good)?
  - Division of labor.
      - Is there one person doing all of the work (bad) or do 
        all group members contribute (good)?
  - Intermediate results.
      - Do you save cleaned data to the output folder to be used later (good)
        or do you re-clean the dataset each time you open up an analysis
        file (bad)?
  - Informative README
      - Does your README file contain an informative title? Does it
        *briefly* describe the goals of the project?
