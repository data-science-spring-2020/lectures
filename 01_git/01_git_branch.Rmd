# Learning Objectives

- Learn the branch-commit-merge workflow for collaborative repos.
- [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [About branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches)
- [Resolving a merge conflict](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)

# Motivation

- We previously learned how to fork a repo. This allows you to collaborate
  on a repo that you don't own.

- You might also share a repo with someone. In this case, we use *branches*
  rather than forks.
